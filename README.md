**Cap Collectif** is a french start up that aims at supporting decision-makers who want to change their decision-making process towards more transparency and inclusion.
To do that, we provide decision-makers with a **fully customizable online platform** integrating **10 different tools**, each dedicated to a specific **participatory process** (consultation, which aims at setting up debates in a controlled and organized framework, participatory budgeting, survey, call for proposals, suggestion box, etc.).
Our technology is based on a collective intelligence methodology inspired by the Open Gov‚Äôs doctrine created by Barack Obama ‚Äî and since adopted by 79 countries in the world ‚Äî in order to reinforce the efficiency of public policies and rebuild citizens‚Äô trust.
