This is our [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) administration.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/admin-next](http://localhost:3000//admin-next) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/*` directory is mapped to `/admin-next/*`.
