Feature: ProposalResponse Restful Api
  As an API client

#  Scenario: Anonymous API client wants to get all proposalResponses from a Proposal
#    When I send a GET request to "/api/proposal_forms/1/proposals/1/responses"
#    Then the JSON response should match:
#"""
#[
#  {
#    "id": @integer@,
#    "value": @string@,
#    "created_at": "@string@.isDateTime()",
#    "updated_at": "@string@.isDateTime()"
#  },
#  @...@
#]
#"""
