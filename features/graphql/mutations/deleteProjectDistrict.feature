Scenario: Admin wants to delete a district in projects
  Given I am logged in to graphql as admin
  And I send a GraphQL POST request:
   """
   {
    "query": "mutation ($input: DeleteProjectDistrictInput!) {
      deleteProjectDistrict(input: $input) {
        deletedDistrictId
      }
    }",
    "variables": {
      "input": {
        "id": "projectDistrict1"
      }
    }
  }
  """
  Then the JSON response should match:
  """
  {
    "data": {
      "deleteProjectDistrict": {
          "deletedDistrictId": "projectDistrict1"
       }
     }
  }
  """
  And I send a GraphQL POST request:

      projectDistricts {
        id
        name
